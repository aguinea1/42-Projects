### 📁 [libft](https://github.com/aguinea1/libft)  
A foundational C library reimplementing standard functions like `memcpy`, `strdup`, and `atoi`, serving as a base for future projects.

---

### 📁 [get_next_line](https://github.com/aguinea1/get_next_line)  
A function designed to read a file line by line, handling various edge cases and ensuring efficient memory management.

---

### 📁 [pipex](https://github.com/aguinea1/pipex)  
A project that replicates the shell's pipeline behavior, managing file descriptors and process execution to mimic commands like `ls | grep txt`.

---

### 📁 [Fract-ol](https://github.com/aguinea1/Fract-ol)  
A graphical project that generates fractal images like Mandelbrot and Julia sets, utilizing complex numbers and graphical libraries.

---

### 📁 [Push-Swap-WR](https://github.com/aguinea1/Push-Swap-WR)  
An algorithmic challenge focused on sorting data using a limited set of stack operations, emphasizing efficiency and optimization in this code I acomplished sorting 500 random numbers in 4150 moves.

---

### 📁 [Push-Swap-Turco](https://github.com/aguinea1/Push-Swap-Turco)  
A variation of the Push-Swap project, implementing alternative strategies to achieve optimal sorting sequences.

---
### 📁 [minishell](https://github.com/aguinea1/minishell)  
A miniature shell implementation supporting built-in commands, environment variables, and command parsing with proper syntax handling.

---

### 📁 [Philosophers](https://github.com/aguinea1/Philosophers)  
An exploration of concurrency and synchronization, simulating the classic dining philosophers problem using threads and mutexes.

### 🔹 [CPP Module 00](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP00)  
The first module in  C++.  
It introduces essential concepts such as classes, private attributes, public methods, object instantiation, and basic stream handling.  
Perfect for understanding the shift from C to C++ through a more structured and object-oriented approach.
